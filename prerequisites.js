  Much of the things that I encountered while doing the prerequisites for the application were things that I had encountered before in my own studies of programming languages.  \
  However tha subject that was most enlightening for me was ES6 within javascript on freeCodeCamp. \
  ES6 was something that I had encountered before in passing, but never actually explored. \
  As such the module on it within freeCodeCamp was my first usage of it to an extent. \
  I now have a much greater understanding of what ES6 is and whats its function is for use with javascript. \
  I have used ES6 with coding before, but this was always small sections that were for the specific thing that I was looking for. \
  I hadn't taken a deep dive into what exactly it was fully capable of. \
  The prerequisites meant that I took a deeper look into what exactly ES6 was as an extension of javascript, and what it could be used for. \
